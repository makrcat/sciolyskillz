# Types of Bone Cells

The human skeleton is constantly remodeled and maintained by several specialized bone cell types. Each one plays a distinct role in bone formation, maintenance, and reabsorption.

  <div>
    The <span className="accent">osteoblasts</span>, <span className="accent">osteogenic</span> (progenitor) cells, and <span className="accent">osteoclasts</span> are located on bone **surfaces**, such as the <strong>periosteum</strong> (outer surface) and <strong>endosteum</strong> (inner lining).

    The <span className="accent">osteocytes</span>(mature bone cells) reside **deep within the bone matrix**, trapped in small spaces called **lacunae**.

    <br /><br />
    ✨ <strong>Osteo</strong> means bone, and <strong>cyte</strong> means cell: so an <strong>osteocyte</strong> is a fully matured bone cell!

### Osteoblasts 

<span className="accent">Osteoblasts</span> live on the **surfaces of bone** (That's the **periosteal AND endosteal**, inside it too!) and are responsible for **building new bone**. They secrete a soft, organic matrix called <span className="accent">osteoid</span>, which later mineralizes to become hard bone.

They originate from **mesenchymal stem cells**, and when they become trapped in the matrix they've secreted, they transform into **osteocytes**.

Osteoprogenitor cells →<br />
Osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) →<br />
Osteocytes (mature bone-maintaining cells)
</div>

Osteoblasts are fairly simple, and have a singular nucleus. They also secrete collagen (in the osteoid mix) & calcium phosphate.
    - **Collagen** gives bone its flexibility & strength against pulling.
    - **Calcium phosphate** gives bone it's compression resistance.
They're found on bone surfaces during growth & repair.


Once they're trapped in their own bone matrix, osteoblasts mature into osteocytes.

### Inactive Osteoblasts

Bone lining cells, or <span className="accent">inactive osteoblasts</span> are flattened, inactive osteoblasts that remain on the bone surface when no active remodeling is occurring.

- They are derived from osteoblasts
- Cover resting bone surfaces
- Help regulate calcium/phosphate movement
- May reactivate to become osteoblasts again during remodeling

### Osteogenic Cells

<span className="accent">Osteogenic cells</span> (osteoprogenitor cells) are stem-like cells found in the periosteum, endosteum, and bone marrow.

- Undifferentiated and mitotically active
- Differentiate into osteoblasts when needed
- Essential for:
  - Bone growth
  - Fracture healing
  - Maintaining the supply of bone-building cells

### Osteocytes

Once osteoblasts get trapped in the mineralized bone matrix, they become <span className="accent">osteocytes</span>.

- Live in small cavities called **lacunae**, in the bone matrix!
    - One example of this is in the bone units of <span className="accent">osteons</span>, and everywhere else too.
- Maintain bone tissue and monitor strain/stress
- Extend "arms" through **canaliculi** to communicate with other cells, or call upon help if sense damage to the bone.
- Help regulate calcium levels in blood and bone

---

### Osteoclasts

<span className="accent">Osteoclasts</span> are **large, multinucleated cells** that break down bone.

- Derived from the **monocyte/macrophage lineage**
- Perform **bone resorption** (breaking down old or damaged bone)
- Use enzymes and acids to dissolve mineralized matrix
- Critical for:
  - Bone remodeling
  - Releasing calcium and phosphate into the bloodstream

Roughly 5–10% of your skeleton is remodeled each year!
