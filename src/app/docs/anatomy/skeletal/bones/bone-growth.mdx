# Two Types of Bone Growth  

Bone grows in two key ways, similar to how cartilage grows (although with different mechanisms, obviously.)

### Appositional Growth → Increases Width

<span class="accent">Appositional growth</span> occurs when new bone matrix is added to the bone **surfaces**, expanding the bone’s thickness.

- Happens at both the **periosteal (outer)** and **endosteal (inner)** surfaces
- **Osteoblasts** in the periosteum secrete matrix onto the outer surface
- **Osteoclasts** in the endosteum resorb bone on the inside, enlarging the marrow cavity.

### Interstitial Growth → Increases length

<span class="accent">Interstitial growth</span> isn't directly bone growth; It's actually bone replacing cartilage. It happens especially at the epiphyseal plate (growth plate) during development. This is called <span class="accent">endochondral ossification </span>.

It actually happens most during childhood and adolescence, hence growing taller.

- Chondrocytes divide and secrete new cartilage matrix **from within**
- This pushes the epiphysis away from the diaphysis
- Later, osteoblasts ossify the cartilage into bone.
