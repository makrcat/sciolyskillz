# Types of Bone Cells: 

Osteoblasts 
- baby. Smol. Young. Bone forming cells
- single nucleus, mineralize bone matrix

& Inactive Osteoblasts (Bone lining cells) 
- live along the surface of most bones in adults
- thought to regulate the movement of calcium and phosphate into and out of the bone 

these become:
Osteocytes - mature bone cells made from osteoblasts
- maintain bone structure, through biomineralization
- control the calcium release from the bone tissue to the blood 

Osteoclasts - break down bone structure to renew the material
- Lots of lysosomes inside, which contain enzymes and acids that dissolve bone
- Bone remodeling - every year, about 5-10% of the skeleton is remodeled
Process of breaking down bone may also release minerals , like calcium

Osteogenic (osteoprogenitor) cells - are undifferentiated stem cells, precursor to osteoblasts.
- repair damaged bone
- precursor to more specialized bone cells
