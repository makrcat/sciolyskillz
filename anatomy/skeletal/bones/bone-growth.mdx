# Two types of bone growth (similar to cartilage)
Appositional - cells in the perichondrium secrete matrix onto existing cartilage. 
[NOT COLLAGEN]
Appositional growth occurs at endosteal and periosteal surfaces (outside, inside) and increases width of bones

Interstitial - matrix secreted within the cartilage instead of along surfaces, and allows the bone to grow longer. cell division
