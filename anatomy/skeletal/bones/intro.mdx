# Bones

## Introduction

A <span class="accent">bone</span> is a very hard tissue that makes up parts of the skeleton. 
Bones give shape and support to the human body + protect organs. 
They also serve as a storage site for some minerals, as well as make blood cells.

The human body has 
<span class="accent">206 bones</span>. 
These can be split into two categories:

- The <span class="accent">axial skeleton</span> (80 bones) is the central part of the skeletal structure. 
Its main function is to protect and support the body's vital organs. 
The axial skeleton includes the **skull, vertebrae, thoracic cage, and hyoid bone** (a U-shaped in the neck that supports tongue)

- The <span class="accent">appendicular skeleton</span> (126 bones) is the extremities of the skeleton, and it includes **the extremeties and two girdles** (pectoral and pelvic). Girdles are the ring of bones supporting a limb by connecting it to the axial skeleton.

## 5 Types of bones

### Long bones

A <span class="accent">long bone</span> is a bone that is longer than it is wide, and has a shaft and two ends. They're usually **strong, dense bones**, responsible for **providing mobility & bearing weight**.

### Structure

We'll go into long bones in more detail later, but here's the general structure:

The <span class="accent">diaphysis</span> is the **shaft, or the middle** part of the long bone. It contains compact bone.

The <span class="accent">epiphysis</span> are the **ends** of the bone, and contain spongy bone & red marrow.  

(The <span class="accent">metaphysis</span> is in the **middle between those two**, and helps transfer weight from the epiphysis to the diaphysis.)

The <span class="accent">medullary cavity</span> is the hollow middle part of the bone. It contains yellow marrow, for fat storage. It also contains stem cells.

### Where is all this stuff?

The following bones are long bones: 

**femur, tibia, fibula, humerus, ulna, radius, clavicle, metacarpals, metatarsals, phalanges**

Most long bones are in the **limbs**.

Sometimes bones in the fingers are classified as long bones too, due to bone structure!

### Short Bones

<span class="accent">Short bones</span> are small bones that are roughly round-ish and cube shaped. They're small and slide past each other, and exist in the palm of your hands and feet.

- Function: shock absorption, flexibility  
- Structure: mostly spongy bone with thin compact bone layer  
List: carpals in the wrist, tarsals in the ankles

### Sesamoid Bones


<span class="accent">Sesamoid bones</span> are short bones embedded in tendons  
- Function: relieve tension from within the muscles and tendons by essentially acting as a fulcrum in a pulley system. They improve the mechanical advantage of muscles.
- Structure: embedded in tendons & provide a structure for tendons to attach onto. Also inner spongy, outer compact  
Example: kneecap (patella)

### Flat Bones

<span class="accent">Flat bones</span> are literally flat bone (plates). They're usually thin and curved .
- Function: protection for important internal organs, such as the brain & pelvic organs  
- Structure: compact-spongy-compact sandwich  
Example: skull bones, sternum, ribs, scapulae

### Irregular Bones

<span class="accent">Irregular bones</span>: these bones often have irregular shapes.  
- Function: varies, but mostly protection & articulation  
- Structure: also varies, hence the name.
List: hip, vertebrae
