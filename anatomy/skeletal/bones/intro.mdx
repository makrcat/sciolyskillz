# Bones

### Introduction

A <span class="accent">bone</span> is a very hard tissue that makes up parts of the skeleton. 
Bones give shape and support to the human body + protect organs. 
They also serve as a storage site for some minerals, as well as make blood cells.

The human body has 
<span class="accent">206 bones</span>. 
These can be split into two categories:

The <span class="accent">axial skeleton</span> (80 bones) is the central part of the skeletal structure. 
Its main function is to protect and support the body's vital organs. 
<span class="accent">Skull, vertebrae, thoracic cage, hyoid bone</span> (U-shaped in the neck that supports tongue)

The <span class="accent">appendicular skeleton</span> (126 bones) is the extremities of the skeleton, and it includes <span class="accent">the extremeties and two girdles</span> (pectoral and pelvic). 
Girdles are the ring of bones supporting a limb by connecting it to the axial skeleton.



### 5 Types of bones

<span class="accent">Long bones</span> - a bone that is longer than it is wide, has a shaft and two ends  
Function: Strong, dense bones, responsible for providing mobility & bearing weight.  
Structure:  
Diaphysis (shaft) → Compact bone  
Epiphysis (ends) → Spongy bone, red marrow  
Medullary cavity → Contains yellow marrow (fat storage)  
Sometimes bones in the fingers are classified as long bones, due to bone structure  
List: femur, tibia, fibula, humerus, ulna, radius, clavicle, metacarpals, metatarsals, phalanges

<span class="accent">Short bones</span> - small bones that are roughly round-ish and cube shaped.  
Function: shock absorption, flexibility  
Structure: mostly spongy bone with thin compact bone layer  
List: carpals in the wrist, tarsals in the ankles

<span class="accent">Sesamoid bones</span> - short bones that are embedded in tendons  
Function: relieve tension from within the muscles and tendons by essentially acting as a fulcrum in a pulley system. They improve the mechanical advantage of muscles. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=XnYO4TnpTCo)  
Structure: embedded in tendons & provide a structure for tendons to attach onto. Also inner spongy, outer compact  
Example: kneecap (patella)

<span class="accent">Flat bones</span> - literally flat bone (plates), usually thin and curved  
Function: protection for important internal organs, such as the brain & pelvic organs  
Structure: compact-spongy-compact sandwich  
Example: skull bones, sternum, ribs, scapulae

<span class="accent">Irregular bones</span> - these bones often have irregular shapes  
Function: varies, protection & articulation  
Structure: varies  
List: hip, vertebrae
