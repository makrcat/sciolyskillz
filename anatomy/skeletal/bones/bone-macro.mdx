# Identifying structures in a long bone

*<a href="https://youtu.be/rDGqkMHPDqE?si=bqlvV3rXlPIbvwTE&t=232">Relevant Crash Course video</a> which is really good for visualizing.*

    Recap here: 

    <span class="accent">epiphysis</span> - expanded ends of long bones, covered in hyaline cartilage<br />
    <span class="accent">diaphysis</span> (shaft) <br />
    <span class="accent">metaphysis</span> - middle part between the end of the bone and the shaft, epiphyseal line<br />

    <span class="accent">Bone marrow</span> resides in the <span class="accent">medullary cavity</span>. 
    - <span class="accent">Red bone marrow</span> produces blood cells.
    - <span class="accent">Yellow bone marrow</span> stores fat.

    Note:

     ❝Red bone marrow is replaced by yellow bone marrow as you age. In cases of extreme blood loss, the body may willingly revert yellow bone marrow back to red bone marrow, increasing the production of blood cells.❞

<span class="accent">Articular cartilage</span> is a layer that covers the outside of the epiphysis joint surface.
The <span class="accent">epiphyseal line</span> is a **disc of hyaline cartilage** located in the metaphysis for adult long bones.

The **outer surface** is covered by a white membrane – the <span class="accent">periosteum</span>, which is secured to the bone by collagen fibers known as <span class="accent">Sharpey’s fibers</span>. The **inner surface** is covered by the <span class="accent">endosteum.</span>

    <div>
    <span class="accent">Osteons</span> are long cylindrical units inside of compact areas of bones. 

    The <span class="accent">Haversian canal</span> runs through the center of each osteon. Volkmann’s canals run perpendicular to these, and allow nutrients into the bone.

    The microscopic bone section will be about the inside of each bone unit.
