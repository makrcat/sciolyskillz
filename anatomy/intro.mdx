# Anatomy & Physiology C
Anatomy and Physiology (Division C) concentrates on three topics per year, which rotate in a usually predictable way. The following are updated for the **2026 season**.

<TopicCard 
title="Nervous System" 
subtext="The brain, spinal cord, and nerves that coordinate and transmit signals across the body.">
</TopicCard>

<TopicCard title="Sense Organs" 
subtext="Organs that detect and relay sensory information to the brain.">
</TopicCard>

<TopicCard title="Endocrine System" 
subtext="A network of glands that release hormones to regulate growth, metabolism, and mood.">
</TopicCard>

## What will I be tested on?
