# sciolyskillz

![banner](READMEimages/banner.png)

This is a site to help prep for SciOly, or [Science Olympiad](https://www.soinc.org/). 

## but why?
I noticed that all the scioly resources online were quite scattered, so I hope this website can be a central hub of information, much like https://usaco.guide/.

It's also a way for me to learn more about using React.js and Firebase as a backend, as well how to integrate it with front-end web design :)
